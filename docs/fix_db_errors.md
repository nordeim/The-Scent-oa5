The error occurs because MySQL does not allow using the `IDENTIFIED BY` clause in the `GRANT` statement if the user already exists. In MySQL 8.0 and later, you must create the user first with the password, and then grant privileges in a separate statement.

**Here’s how to do it correctly:**

1. **Create the user (if they don’t already exist):**

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'scent_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'StrongPassword123';
   ```

2. **Grant privileges on the database:**

   ```sql
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON the_scent.* TO 'scent_user'@'localhost';
   ```

3. **Refresh the privileges (if needed):**

   ```sql
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

If the user already exists, simply omit the `IDENTIFIED BY` part in the `GRANT` command:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON the_scent.* TO 'scent_user'@'localhost';
```

This separation of user creation and privilege granting in MySQL 8.0 is designed to provide better security and clarity in user management.

There isn’t a per‐user default database setting built into MySQL. Instead, you achieve the desired behavior by specifying the desired database when the connection is made. Here are several approaches:

1. **Specify at Login via the MySQL Client:**  
   When logging in interactively using the command line, add the database name with the `-D` (or `--database`) option. For example:  
   ```bash
   mysql -u scent_user -p -D the_scent
   ```  
   This tells the client to use the `the_scent` database immediately upon connection.

2. **Set Up a Client Configuration File:**  
   If you (or the operating system account for `scent_user`) frequently log in without specifying the database each time, you can put the credentials and default database in a configuration file (such as `~/.my.cnf`). For example:  
   ```ini
   [client]
   user=scent_user
   password=StrongPassword123
   database=the_scent
   ```  
   With this file in place (and proper permissions so your password isn’t world-readable), the MySQL client will automatically use `the_scent` on login.

3. **Use the Application’s Connection String:**  
   As seen in your PHP configuration and PDO connection, you include the database name in the Data Source Name (DSN) string:  
   ```php
   $dsn = "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=the_scent;charset=utf8mb4";
   ```  
   This guarantees that every connection from your application immediately accesses the correct schema.

4. **(Advanced) Using the `init_connect` Variable:**  
   MySQL provides the global system variable `init_connect` to run a command for every client connection that does not have the SUPER privilege. You can set this variable to run a statement such as `USE the_scent;` automatically:
   ```sql
   SET GLOBAL init_connect = 'USE the_scent;';
   ```  
   **Important:**  
   - This command runs for every non-SUPER user connection. If you have other users needing a different default or none at all, you can’t target it only to `scent_user` without adding conditional logic—which is not standard practice.  
   - Users with SUPER privileges won’t have this executed.  
   - Be cautious with this setting as it applies server-wide, and ensure that it doesn’t disrupt users who might expect a different default.

In summary, while MySQL does not allow you to directly “assign” a default schema to a particular user on the server side, you can ensure that the `the_scent` database is used by including it in your connection parameters (either via the DSN for applications, with the `-D` option for the command-line client, or via a configuration file). This way, every time `scent_user` connects, the proper database is in effect.

---

There might be further steps to consider if you’re encountering authentication issues (as suggested by the error message in your curl example). Verify that the privileges for `scent_user` on the `the_scent` database have been properly granted. For example, running a command like: 

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON the_scent.* TO 'scent_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'StrongPassword123';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

ensures that the user can access that schema. If you’d like to dive deeper into how MySQL handles user logins and privileges or discuss other methods to streamline database access, I’d be happy to elaborate further.
