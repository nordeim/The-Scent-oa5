This file will serve as:

- ✅ The **first impression** developers and collaborators will have
- ✅ A **documentation hub** for installing, deploying, and understanding the project
- ✅ A **marketing touchpoint** to showcase what the platform is, how it works, and how to contribute

Thus, it must be:

- **Authoritative**: describing all core features and how they work
- **Helpful**: guiding users through setup and usage
- **Beautiful**: formatted with visuals, code blocks, emojis, badges, etc.
- **Complete**: covering everything from installation to extensibility

## 🧱 System Architecture

**MVC-like Modular PHP Architecture:**

```
[Browser]
   ↓
[Apache2 Server]
   ↓
[public/index.php] → [Router] → [Controllers] → [Models] → [MySQL DB]
            ↑             ↓         ↓
         [Views]     [Includes]   [Sessions]
```

- `Controllers`: Handle business logic
- `Models`: DB abstraction layer (PDO)
- `Views`: HTML templates
- `Includes`: Shared components (header, footer, db)

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | HTML5, Tailwind CSS, AOS.js, Particles.js |
| Backend | PHP 8.0+, Apache2 |
| Database | MySQL 5.7+ |
| Animations | AOS.js (fade/slide), Particles.js |
| Version Control | Git |

## 🧪 Scent Quiz

The scent quiz is a unique feature that:
- Asks users to select a **mood or need** (Relaxation, Energy, Focus, etc.)

<think>

Absolutely. We’re mid-way through building a **high-quality, 3000+ word `README.md`** file for *The Scent* GitHub repository. We've already completed:

- Project heading  
- Badges  
- Table of contents  
- Introduction  
- Screenshots  
- Architecture  
- Technology stack  
- Folder structure  
- Database schema  
- Installation instructions  
- Deployment guide summary  
- Scent quiz overview

Now we’ll continue with the remaining sections:

- 🛡️ Security Best Practices  
- 🔧 Customization & Extensibility  
- 🤝 Contribution Guidelines  
- 📄 License  
- 🙏 Credits  
- 📎 Appendix / Additional Resources  

Each section will include detailed, helpful content, code examples, and markdown best practices to make the document not only long enough (~3000+ words) but clear, professional, and highly usable.

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

Security is a top priority in *The Scent*. The platform includes several measures to protect user data and maintain safe operations across the stack.

### 🔐 Authentication

- Passwords are hashed using `password_hash()` (bcrypt).
- Login uses `password_verify()` to compare hashes.
- Sessions are initiated securely with `session_start()`.

```php
if (password_verify($inputPassword, $user['password'])) {
    $_SESSION['user'] = $user;
}
```

### 🛡️ Input Sanitization

- All inputs are sanitized using:
  - `htmlspecialchars()` for XSS protection
  - `filter_input()` for validation
  - Prepared statements via PDO for SQL injection prevention

```php
$email = htmlspecialchars($_POST['email']);
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?");
```

### 🔒 File Permissions

- `config.php` permissions are set to `640`
- Upload directories like `public/uploads` are restricted to `www-data` only

```bash
chmod 640 config.php
chown www-data:www-data config.php
```

### 🔄 CSRF Protection (Future Enhancement)

We recommend integrating CSRF tokens into forms for additional protection:

```php
<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="<?= $_SESSION['csrf_token'] ?>">
```

---

## 🔧 Customization & Extensibility

The codebase is built with flexibility in mind. You can easily extend it to suit your business needs.

### ➕ Add a New Product

1. Add via the admin dashboard (or insert into `products` table):

```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, price, image, category_id, stock)
VALUES ('New Scent Oil', 29.99, '/images/scent9.jpg', 1, 50);
```

2. Set `is_featured = 1` to feature it on the homepage.

### ➕ Add a New Quiz Option

Update the quiz mapping:

```php
// quiz_mappings.php
'confidence' => [9, 10] // Add new mood mapping
```

Then update the quiz form in `/views/quiz.php`.

### 🔐 Add Admin Roles

In `users` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN role ENUM('user', 'admin') DEFAULT 'user';
```

Then restrict admin URLs:

```php
if ($_SESSION['user']['role'] !== 'admin') {
    die("Access Denied");
}
```

### 🔌 Integrate Stripe or PayPal

You can easily connect Stripe’s PHP SDK to the checkout flow in `OrderController.php`.
