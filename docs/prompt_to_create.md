You are a deep-thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution before answering. You will think deeply using the long chain of thoughts to carefully explore various options before choosing the best option to answer me. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

Your task is spelled out in the attached task_specification.md file. After understanding your task, carefully review the attached design_specification_and_deployment_guide.md, 'improved landing page.html', style.css, README.md, sample_design_template_using_PHP_and_MySQL.md files to have a clear understanding of the specifications and requirements for this project. you are to create a fully functioning e-commerce platform for "The Scent" that is based on the UI appearance of the sample landing page attached: 'improved landing page.html' and style.css.

With a complete understanding of the project requirements and the given specifications, as well as a complete understanding of the current state of the project, think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly for the best implementation option to complete your task. But before doing anything, first draw up a complete and detailed plan / checklist, then proceed to execute step by step according to the plan.

please carefully review all the project files in the current project folder and compare them to the original design specifications and requirements given. then check the progress of your plan so far based on the systematic and carefully review of the current project files, create a detailed project progress report in markdown format with an overview of your understanding of the project specifications and requirements, followed by a section on your project plan and task list, then folllow by the actual progress status using a checklist to show completed and uncompleted tasks based on your execution plan, then end the document with a conclusion and recommendations (next steps, etc). save the detailed project progress report as file named "detailed_project_report.md" under the project root folder.

remember to think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughtly the best implementation option before making changes or executiing.

Verify carefully whether the following are already in place?

1. Cart functionality (add, update, remove items)
2. Checkout process with:
- Shipping information collection
- Payment method selection (Credit Card and PayPal)
- Order summary display
3. Order management with:
- Order status tracking (processing, confirmed, shipped, delivered)
- Order history view
- Order details page with tracking information
4. Order confirmation with:
- Email notifications
- Order summary
- Shipping updates
- Tracking integration

Verify that the checkout system is secure, validates required fields, and has proper error handling. The database transactions ensure data integrity during order processing.

Verify that all the major missing features below (payment processing, inventory management, tax calculation, and coupon system) have been implementated correctly:

**Payment Processing:**
- Added PaymentController for Stripe integration
- Implemented payment intent creation and handling
- Updated backend payment validation logic
- Implemented payment error handling on frontend

**Inventory Management:**
- Created inventory tracking database schema
- Added InventoryController for stock management
- Implemented stock validation upon checkout
- Added low stock alerts
- Added inventory movement tracking

**Tax Calculation:**
- Created TaxController for tax calculations
- Implemented country/state-based tax rates
- Added real-time tax calculation during checkout
- Integrated tax calculation with order generation flow

**Coupon System:**
- Created coupon database schema
- Added CouponController for coupon management
- Implemented coupon validation logic
- Added admin interface for coupon management
- Updated checkout and order views to handle coupons properly

Let us first search the workspace to understand the current state. Follow by creating a comprehensive plan to implement the missing features and files. Let us think systematically about what we need to do.
