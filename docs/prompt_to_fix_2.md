good job in your review. now help me fix the relevant code files to fix the critical mismatches identified in your review:

Header/Nav            | Yes           | Partial      | Partial          | Icon layout, nav link structure, sticky behavior 
Featured Products	Yes	Partial	Good	Card style, CTA, badges differ
Newsletter	Yes	Partial	Good	Input/button style and consent note
Footer	Yes	Partial	Partial	Column layout, content, payment icons missing

again think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly for the best implementation option to close the current UI gaps versus the sample UI design before choosing the most optimal option to fix the gaps without affecting the functionality and logic of the PHP application. before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.

now, with your thorough understanding of the current state of the project based on the actual review of the project files in the codebase, carefully check whether its current UI design for the main land page matches the sample UI design for the landing page in the sample_landing_page_design folder (the sample_landing_page_design/index.html and sample_landing_page_design/style.css files). then think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly for the best implementation option to document down in the markdown document "current_UI_design_review.md" your assessment results and findings, issues identified, and suggested fixes. document the details clearly and logically your current UI design review versus sample UI design reference, with code snippets and explanation. this document will help with future UI design improvements.

again carefully plan how you will create the review document, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.
