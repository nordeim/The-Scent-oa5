**Current Implementation:**  
- Logo left, subtitle present but styling may differ.

    </div>
    <nav class="main-nav">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#hero">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#products">Shop</a></li>
        ...

## Final Recommendations

- **Adopt a design system:** Codify design tokens (colors, fonts, shadows, border-radius) in a shared config to reduce drift.
- **Refactor markup:** Where possible, match the HTML structure/classes to the sample for easier maintenance.
- **Refine CSS:** Adjust custom classes and Tailwind config to bring the live UI closer to the sample.
- **Align content:** Ensure all copy, links, and headings match the reference for consistency.
- **Enhance accessibility:** Double-check color contrast, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation.
- **Iterative testing:** Use side-by-side comparison and design review to incrementally close the gap.
